### Title
Diversity and Inclusion in Free & Open Source Software


### Description (short)

Diversity & inclusion is very important especially for free & open source community, because people in tech nowadays are hired to a big part because of their open source contributions. To improve the balance there, the free & open source software community is an important starting point.

We are building https://opensourcediversity.org to collect the projects and resources in this field. It is aimed at maintainers and contributors of open source projects who want to improve, as well as people from underrepresented groups who are interested in free & open source software but donâ€™t know where to start.
